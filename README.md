# Techtree Practice Hub

Welcome to **Techtree Practice Hub**! This repository is a dedicated space for practicing technical tools and coding, with a focus on honing skills across multiple development environments and technologies. The practice exercises are designed to be generated by ChatGPT or other AI models, providing versatile and adaptive training scenarios that suit a wide range of tech learning needs.

## Goals

1. **Technical Tools & Coding Practice**: Gain hands-on experience with various development tools, languages, and frameworks.
2. **AI-Generated Training**: Utilize prompts and tasks generated by ChatGPT and similar AI models to create an engaging and comprehensive practice suite.

## Monorepo Structure

This repository is organized using a **monorepo structure**, allowing for efficient management of multiple projects and dependencies in one place. Each practice area, such as Docker, React, Kubernetes, and AWS, is structured within its own workspace, facilitating isolated dependency management and targeted learning.

### Project Structure

The repository may contain subfolders for each technology, structured as follows:

techtree-practice-hub

├── \_\_-prac

Each folder contains code, configuration files, and documentation for specific practice exercises.
